Description

You have an empty array A and a positive integer X. You are given Q queries with an integer Y, which you have to append to the array. In one move, you can change Y as: Y = Y + X or Y = Y - X, Y cannot become negative. You can perform this move multiple times. After each query, find the maximum MEX of the array. 

The MEX of an array is the minimum excluded non-negative integer.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers Q X - the number of queries and value of X.

Each of the next lines contain one integer Y - the element you have to append in the array.


Output Format

For each test case, print the MEX for each query as space-separated integers.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 105

1≤ X ≤ 105

0≤ Yi ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Note

For the first test case, the given array can be changed to: [2, 0, 1, 5] from [5 3 1 2] , X=3. (all changes are with adding and subtracting X from the numbers).

The mex of [2] is 0
The mex of [2, 0] is 1
The mex of [2, 0, 1] is 3
The mex of [2, 0, 1, 5] is 3

For the second test case, the given array can be changed to: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]

For the third test case, the given array can be changed to: [0, 1, 2]
