You are given an array A of N integers and an integer K. Find the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and abs(Ai - Aj) = K


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N K - the length of the array and the required absolute difference.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and abs(Ai - Aj) = K


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 109

1≤ K ≤ 10^9.

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Notice K≠0, can you handle the case when K=0?

Note

For the first test case, following pairs have absolute difference 2: [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5]

For the second test case, following pairs have absolute difference 1: [3, 2], [1, 2]

For the third test case, no pair has absolute difference 10.
