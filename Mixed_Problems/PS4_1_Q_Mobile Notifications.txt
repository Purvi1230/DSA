Description

You recently bought a new mobile phone. There are N applications in the phone and all generate notifications. There are 3 types of events

1 X - A new notification is generated by application X
2 X - You read all notifications by application X, you may re-read some notifications
3 Y - You read the first Y notifications in the phone. Note that you don’t read the first Y unread notifications, you just read the first Y notifications and you might re-read a few notifications. It is guaranteed that there have been Y notifications before this. 
After every event, find the number of unread notifications in the mobile phone.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N Q - the number of applications and the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated integers Z X or Z Y - the description of each event.


Output Format

For each test case, find the number of unread notifications in the mobile phone after every event.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N, Q ≤ 105

1≤ Z ≤ 3

1≤ X ≤ N

1≤ Y ≤ Q

It is guaranteed that the sum of N and the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106.
