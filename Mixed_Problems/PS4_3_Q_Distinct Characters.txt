Description

You are given a string S. You are given Q queries of two types, asking the number of distinct characters in the range [L, R] and changing the i-th character to c. (1-based indexing)


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test contains a string S.

The second line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries. 

Each of the next Q lines contain two types of queries: either 1 i c or 2 L R. The query 1 is for changing the i-th character to c and the query 2 is for finding the number of distinct characters in the range [L, R].


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ |S| ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 106

1≤ Ai ≤ 105

It is guaranteed that the sum of |S| and the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Note

For the first test case, distinct characters from 1-3 in abbac are ‘a’ and ‘b’. Changing string to acbac, distinct characters from 1-3 in abcac are ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’.

For the second test case, distinct characters from 2-5 in flower are ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘w’, ‘e’. Changing string to fllwer and then to fllwee, distinct characters from 1-6 are ‘f’, ‘l’, ‘w’, ‘e’.
