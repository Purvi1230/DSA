Description

You are given two arrays, A and B of N integers. You have to create a new array, Ci = Ai * D + Bi

Find the maximum number of zeros you can get in the new array Ci taking an optimal value of D. (D is a real number)


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - array Ai

The third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - array Bi


Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum number of zeros you can get in the new array Ci taking an optimal value of D.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ N ≤ 106

-109 ≤ Ai, Bi ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Note

For the first test case, take D = -2

For the second test case, take D = -½, C = [1,0,1]

For the third test case, take D = -1/4, C = [4,0,0]
