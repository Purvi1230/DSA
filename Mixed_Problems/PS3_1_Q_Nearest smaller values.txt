Description

You are given an array of N integers. For each position, find the nearest position to its left having a smaller value. (1-based indexing)


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print N space-separated integers, for each position, the nearest position to its left having a smaller value.  If no position to its left has a smaller value, print 0.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.


Sample Input 1

3
5
3 5 1 6 2
4
1 1 2 1

1 3 2 6 6

Sample Output 1

0 1 0 3 3 
0 0 2 0 
0 1 1 3 3

Note

For the first test case, for 3 there is no smaller value, for 5, A[1] = 3, for 1, there is no smaller value, for 6 A[3] = 1, for 2, A[3] = 1.

For the second test case, for all 1 there is no smaller value, for 2, A[2] = 1.

For the third test case, for 1 there is no smaller value, for 3 and 2, A[1] = 1, for 6 and 6, A[3] = 2
