Description

You are given an array A of N integers. Find the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and Ai + Aj is a power of 2.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and Ai + Aj is a power of 2.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 230

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Note

For the first test case, possible pairs having powers of two as sum are: [1, 7], [1, 3], [1, 1], [7, 1], [3, 1]

For the second test case, possible pairs having powers of two as sum are: [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]

For the third test case, possible pairs having powers of two as sum are: [2, 6], [2, 14]
