Description

You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations:

add x - add element x in the set
erase x - delete element with value x, if it exists
find x - if x is present print “YES”, else print “NO”
print - print the values in set
empty - empty the set

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

Each of the next Q ines contains queries.


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 105

1≤ X ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.


Sample Input 1

1
7
add 3
add 2
add 7
print
find 2
erase 2
find 2

Sample Output 1

2 3 7 
YES
NO

Note

Set becomes: [3]
Set becomes: [2, 3]
Set becomes: [2, 3, 7]
Set is: 2, 3, 7.
2 exists in the set
Set becomes: [3, 7]
2 does not exist in the set
