Description

You have N magical candy bag. The i-th bag contains Ai candies. In each minute you can eat all the candies, Ai of one bag, after that, the candies become [Ai / 2] where [x] is the greatest integer less than x. You have K minutes, find the maximum number of candies you can eat.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, K - the number of bags and the number of minutes.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum number of candies you can eat.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N ≤ 105

0≤ K ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of K over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Note

For the first test case, first take 5 candies then the bag becomes: [4, 3, 2, 1], and then take 4 candies to get a total 5+4 = 9 candies.

For the second test case, first take 4 candies, then bag becomes: [2] and then take 2 candies to get a total 4+2 = 6 candies.

For the third test case, first take 5 candies, then bag becomes: [3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2] and then take 3 candies, then bag becomes: [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2], then take 2 candies to get a total 5+3+2 = 10 candies.
