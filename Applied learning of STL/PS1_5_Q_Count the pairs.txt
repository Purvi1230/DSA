Description

You are given an array A of size N. You need to find the number of pairs (i, j) , i != j, such that A[i]+A[j] ≤ X.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N  X.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of pairs (i, j) , i != j, such that A[i]+A[j] ≤ X.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 106

1≤ X ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Note

For the first test case, the following pairs have sum ≤ 4: (1,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)

For the second test case, the following pairs have sum ≤ 10: (5,5), (5,5), (5,5), (5,5), (5,5), (5,5)
