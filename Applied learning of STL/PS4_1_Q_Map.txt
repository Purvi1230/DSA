You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations:

add x y - add student name X (string in lowercase alphabets) with marks y (integer). If it already exists, update.
erase x - erase marks of student with name x, if the entry exists
print x - print marks of student with name x, if entry is not there for x, print 0.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

Each of the next Q ines contains queries.


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 105

1≤ |S| ≤ 50

1≤ Y ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.


Sample Input 1

1
5
add alice 24
add bob 21
print alice
erase alice
print alice

Sample Output 1

24
0

Note

Map becomes: [alice: 24]
Map becomes: [alice: 24, bob: 21]
Value of key alice is 24
Map becomes: [bob: 21]
Key alice does not exist
