Description

You are given the digits of a positive number N. Find the product of its digits. Since the product can be large, print it modulo 109 + 7. It is guaranteed that the number begins with a non-zero digit.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the number of digits in the number. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - the digits of the number.


Output Format

For each test case, print the product of digits of the number modulo 109 + 7.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ N ≤ 106

0≤ D ≤ 9

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Note

For the first test case, 1*5*2*3*4 = 120

For the second test case, 9*0*5*3 = 0

For the third test case, 222 = 8
