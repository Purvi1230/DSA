Description

Implement a queue using 2 stacks. You will be given the following type of Q queries:

push x - add x to the queue
pop - pop the front element of the queue, you also have to print the element you have popped.
front - find the element at the front of the queue

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries

Each of the next Q lines contain the queries.


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ Q ≤ 106

1≤ X ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106.


Sample Input 1

1
7
push 3
push 5
pop
front
push 7
pop
pop

Sample Output 1

3
5
5
7

Note

Queue becomes: [3]
Queue becomes: [3, 5]
Queue becomes [5] and element at front was 3
Queue becomes [5]  and element at front is 5
Queue becomes [5, 7]
Queue becomes [7] and element at front was 5
Queue becomes empty and element at front was 7
