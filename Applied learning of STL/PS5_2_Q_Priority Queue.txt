Description

You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations:

add x - add element x at the top of Priority Queue
remove - delete top element of the Priority Queue, if Priority Queue is not empty
print - print the element at top of the Priority Queue, if Priority Queue is not empty, otherwise print 0

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

Each of the next Q ines contains queries.


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 105

1≤ X ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Note

Priority Queue becomes [4]

Priority Queue becomes [3, 4, 5]
Element at top = 5
Priority Queue becomes [3, 4]
Element at top = 4
