Description

You are given an array of N integers and a size K. Find the maximum integer for every contiguous subarray of size K.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K - the length of the array and the subarray size. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum integer for every contiguous subarray of size K.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ K ≤ N ≤ 106

1≤ Ai ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Note

For the first test case, contiguous subarrays of size 2 are: [3, 1], [1, 2], [2, 5] and [5, 4]. The maximum integers in them are: 3, 2, 5, 5

For the second test case, a contiguous subarray of size 1 is: [1, 3, 2, 6]. The maximum integer is: 6.

For the third test case, contiguous subarrays of size 3 are: [3, 5, 6], [5, 6, 1], [6, 1, 9], [1, 9, 7] and [9, 7, 2]. The maximum integers in them are: 6, 6, 9, 9, 9.
