Description

You are given an array A of size N. You have to answer the following queries

1 x - Find the smallest Element ≥ x 
2 x - Find the smallest Element > x 
3 x - Find the number of elements ≤ x
4 x - Find the number of elements < x
If the answer does not exist print -1.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N Q - the size of the given array and the number of queries

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.

Each of the next Q lines contains the queries in the form of t x.


Output Format

For each test case, print the answer of the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N, Q ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 106

1≤ t ≤ 4

1≤ x ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Note

For the first test case, 

The smallest element ≥ 2 is 2
The smallest element > 2 is 3
The number of elements ≤ 4 is 5 (1, 2, 2, 3, 4)
The number of elements ≤ 2 is 3 (1, 2, 2)
