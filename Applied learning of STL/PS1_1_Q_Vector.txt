Description

You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations:

add x - add element x at the end of vector
remove - delete last element of the vector, if vector is not empty
print x - print the x-th character of the vector, if it exists, otherwise print 0. (0-indexing)
clear - empty the vector

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

Each of the next Q ines contains queries.


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ Q ≤ 106

1≤ X ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106.


Sample Input 1

1
9
add 3
add 4
print 1
remove
add 7
add 2
print 0
clear
print 0

Sample Output 1

4
3
0

Note

Vector becomes: [3]
Vector becomes: [3, 4]
V[1] = 4
Vector becomes: [3]
Vector becomes: [3, 7]
Vector becomes: [3, 7, 2]
V[0] = 3
Vector becomes: []
Vector is empty, hence no element at 0 index
