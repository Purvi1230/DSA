Description

You have an empty set and can perform the following operations on it:

1 x - Add integer x to the set
2 x - Find the smallest integer that is not present in the set, which is greater than or equal to x.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries. 

Each of the next Q lines contain two space-separated integers ti and xi - type and value of the query.


Output Format

For each test case, print the answer for the queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 105

1≤ ti ≤ 2

1≤ xi ≤ 1012

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 106.

Note

For the first test case, the set is [1, 3]. Value which is not present and is ≥ 1 is 2 and ≥ 4 is 4.

For the second test case, the value which is not present and is ≥ 4 is 4. Then set becomes [4]. Value which is not present and is ≥ 4 is 5 now.
