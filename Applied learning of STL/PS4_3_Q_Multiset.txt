Description

You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations:

add x - add element x in the set
erase x - delete one element with value x, if it exists
eraseall x - delete all elements with value x, if it exists
find x - if x is present print “YES”, else print “NO”
count x - print the number of times x occurs in the set
print - print the values in set
empty - empty the set

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

Each of the next Q lines contains queries.

The combination of print and n does not exceed 10^8.


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 105

1≤ X ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105.
