Description

You are given an array of N integers. You have to find the second smallest integer in the given array.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the second smallest integer in the given array. If it doesn’t exist, print -1.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105

1 ≤ N ≤ 105

0 ≤ Ai ≤ 105

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105


Sample Input 1

3
5
3 4 1 7 7
5
1 5 1 2 1
3
1 1 1

Sample Output 1

3
2
-1

Note

For the first test case, the smallest element is 1 and the next smallest element is 3.

For the second test case, the smallest element is 1 and the next smallest element is 2.

For the third test case, the smallest element is 1 and there is no next smallest element.
