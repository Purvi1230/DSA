You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations:

insertback x - add element x at the end of deque
eraseback - delete end element of the queue, if queue is not empty
insertfront x - add element x at the front of deque
erasefront - delete front element of the queue, if queue is not empty
printfront - print element at front of the queue, if queue is not empty, otherwise print 0
printback - print element at back of the queue , if queue is not empty, otherwise print 0
print x - print the x-th character of the vector, if it exists, otherwise print 0. (0-indexing)

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

Each of the next Q ines contains queries.


Output Format

For each test case, print the required queries.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ Q ≤ 105

1≤ X ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of Q over all test cases does not exceed 105
