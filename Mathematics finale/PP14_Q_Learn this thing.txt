Description - Learn this thing

For a given n, find the number of even and odd numbers among the set, { nC0, nC1,... nCn }.

Input Format
First-line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 105), the number of test cases. Next T lines contain one integer per line, denoting n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1012).

Output Format
For each test case, output two space-separated integers specifying the number of even numbers and odd numbers respectively.

Sample Input 1
2
3
4

Sample Output 1
0 4
3 2

Note - For 3, values are: 1 3 3 1. All are odd. Hence 0 4.
For 4, values are: 1 4 6 4 1. Hence 3 2.
