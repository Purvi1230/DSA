Description - Tough Mex

For a (possibly empty) sequence of positive integers S, mex is defined as f(S) as the smallest positive integer that does not appear in S. For example, f([]) = 1, f([3,4,3,5]) = 1, f([2,5,1,1,2,3]) = 4.
You have given a sequence of N integers A1, A2, …, AN. Your task is to find the sum of f(S) over all 2N possible subsequences S of this sequence.
Since the resulting sum can be very big, compute it modulo 998244353.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, …, AN.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the sum of f(S) over all subsequences modulo 998244353.
Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 109 for each valid i

Note - Example case 1: The values for all possible subsequences are f([]) = 1, f([1]) = 2, f([1]) = 2, f([1,1]) = 2.
Example case 2: The values for all possible subsequences are f([]) = 1, f([1]) = 2, f([2]) = 1, f([1]) = 2, f([1,2]) = 3, f([2,1]) = 3, f([1,1]) = 2, f([1,2,1]) = 3.
