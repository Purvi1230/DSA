Description - Sieve of Eratosthenes Revisited

Find all prime numbers between the range from L to R (endpoints inclusive). Print them in non-decreasing order.

Input Format
The only line of input contains L and R, representing the range.

Output Format
The first line of output contains n - the number of prime numbers in between [L, R].
The second line contains n space-separated integers denoting the prime numbers between [L, R] in non-decreasing order.
Constraints
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1012
R - L + 1 ≤ 106
