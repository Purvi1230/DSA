Description

Given an array of N integers and Q queries. Initially, all the elements of the array have value 0.

In each query 4 integers A, D, L, R is given, which means perform AP addition

Arr[L]+=A

Arr[L+1]+=A+D

Arr[L+2]+=A+2D

Arr[L+3]+=A+3D

.

.

.

.

Arr[R]+=A+(R-L)*D.

After performing all the operations. Print the final array % 10^9+7.


Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers N, Q where 1<=N<=10^6, 1<=Q<=10^6.

Next Q lines contain four space-separated integers A, D, L, R where 0<=A,D<=10^4, 1<=L<=R<=N.


Output Format

Print the N space-separated integer representing the final array %10^9+7.
