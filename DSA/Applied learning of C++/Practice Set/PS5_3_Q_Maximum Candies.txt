Description

There are N candies in a shop. Find the maximum number of candies you can buy with the B money you have, given the price of each candy.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and B - the length of the array and money you have.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum number of candies you can buy.
