Description

You are given two rectangles with their lower-left and upper-right coordinates. You have to find the area of the intersection and union of the rectangles. Both rectangles are axis-aligned.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers X1, Y1, X2, Y2 - coordinates of the first rectangle. 

The second line of each test case contains four space-separated integers X3, Y3, X4, Y4 - coordinates of the second rectangle. 


Output Format

For each test case, print the area of intersection and union of the rectangles.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105
-103≤ Xi, Yi ≤ 103
It is guaranteed that X1 ≤ X2, Y1 ≤ Y2, X3 ≤ X4, and Y3 ≤ Y4.
