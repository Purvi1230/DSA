Description

You are given a number N. You have to find the number of trailing zeros in N!

Here, N! = N*(N-1)*...*2*1 and 0! = 1.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of trailing zeros in N!


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

0 ≤ N ≤ 109

Note

For the first test case: 4! = 24

For the second test case: 16! = 20,922,789,888,000

For the third test case, 26! = 403291461126605635584000000
