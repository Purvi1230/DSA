Description

You are given two points on a 2-D plane. You have to find the euclidean and manhattan distance between the two points.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers X1, Y1, X2, Y2.


Output Format

For each test case, print the euclidean and manhattan distance between the two points on a new line. The answer should contain 7 decimal places after round-off.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105

-106 ≤ X1, Y1, X2, Y2 ≤ 106

Note

This problem is for educational purpose, use double instead of long double to store the intermediate values. In the case of a problem where you are being asked to round-off and match the exact numbers till some places after the decimal, you will have to match the data-type used by the setter. generally, these sort of test cases is generated by using some fixed datatype and incase in a test you are unable to get an AC, make sure to try double and floats too.
