Description

You are given an array of N integers. The frequency of exactly one integer is odd. Find that integer.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the integer with odd frequency.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ N ≤ 106  (N is odd)

-109≤ Ai ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 106
