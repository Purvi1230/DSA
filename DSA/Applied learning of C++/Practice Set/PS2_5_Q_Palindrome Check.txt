Description

You are given a string S. You have to tell whether the given string is a palindrome, ignoring any character other than the lower case alphabets (a-z). 


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one string S.


Output Format

For each test case, print whether the given string is a palindrome


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105

It is guaranteed that the sum of the length of S over all test cases does not exceed 105.
