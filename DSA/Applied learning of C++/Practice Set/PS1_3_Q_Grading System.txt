Description

You are given the marks of a student in mid-term, final-term and the make-up examinations. If the student does not attend an exam, marks are assigned as -1. You have to find the grade of the student according to the following guidelines:

If the student does not take the mid-term or the final-term exam, grade is F
If the total score in mid-term and final-term is greater than or equal to 80, grade is A.
If the total score in mid-term and final-term is greater than or equal to 65 and less than 80, grade is B.
If the total score in mid-term and final-term is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 65, grade is C.
If the total score in mid-term and final-term is greater than or equal to 30 and less than 50, grade is D. However, if the score of the make-up examination is greater than or equal to 50, the grade will be C.
If the total score in mid-term and final-term is less than 30, grade is F.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers M, F, R - the marks of the student in the mid-term, final-term and the make-up examinations.


Output Format

For each test case, print the grade of the student.
