Description

You are given an array of N integers. In one operation, you can increase the value of any element by one. Find the minimum number of operations to make the array non-decreasing.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the minimum number of operations to make the array Non-Decreasing.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 105

1≤ N ≤ 105

1≤ Ai ≤ 109

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.

Note

For the first test case, increasing array would be: 4, 5, 5, 9

For the second test case, increasing array would be: 1, 3, 4, 4, 4

For the third test case, increasing array would be: 1, 1, 1
