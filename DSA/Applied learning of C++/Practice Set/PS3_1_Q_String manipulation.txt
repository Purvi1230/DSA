Description

You are given a string S of lowercase alphabets. You are given Q queries and have to perform the following operations: (0-indexing is used)

print a b - print S from a-th to b-th character
reverse a b - reverse S from a-th to b-th character
replace a b p - replace a-th to b-th character with string p, |p| = b-a+1
rotate k - right rotate the array by k

Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one string S.

The second line of each test case contains one integer Q - the number of queries.

The next Q lines contain the description of each query as given in the problem.


Output Format

For each query with print command, print the required substring.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105

1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000

1 ≤ Q ≤ 100

0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ |S| - 1

0 ≤ k ≤ |S| - 1

It is guaranteed that the sum of |S|*Q over all test cases does not exceed 106.


Sample Input 1

1
abcdef
5
reverse 1 3
print 1 4
replace 3 5 xyz
rotate 2
print 0 5

Sample Output 1

dcbe
yzadcx

Note

Given string is abcdef

Reversing from 1-3 character changes it to, adcbef

Replacing from 3-5 characters to xyz changes it to adcxyz

Right rotating by 2 characters changes it to yzadcx
