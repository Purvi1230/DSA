Description

You are given a string S. Ignore the case of characters. Count the frequency of each character from ‘a’ to ‘z’.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one string S.


Output Format

For each test case, print 26 space-separated integers denoting the frequency of each character from ‘a’ to ‘z’.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ |S| ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of |S| over all test cases does not exceed 106.
