Description

You are given an array A of N integers. You have to choose a contiguous arithmetic subarray with equal difference between consecutive integers, that has the maximum length. Find the maximum possible length.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers.


Output Format

For each test case, print the maximum possible length.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 105

2 ≤ N ≤ 105

-107 ≤ Ai ≤ 107

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.
