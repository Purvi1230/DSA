Description

You are given an integer N. You have to find the number of divisors of N.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of divisors of N.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 1000

1 ≤ N ≤ 107


Sample Input 1

3
12
5
9

Sample Output 1

6
2
3

Note

For the first test case, the divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.

For the second test case, the divisors of 5 are: 1, 5.

For the third test case, the divisors of 9 are: 1, 3, 9.
