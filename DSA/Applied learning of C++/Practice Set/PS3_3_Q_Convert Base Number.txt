Description

You are given a number N in base A. Convert the number to base B.

The base of the numbers can be anything such that all digits can be represented using 0 to 9 and A to Z.

The value of ‘A’ is 10, ‘B’ is 11, ‘C’ is 12 and so on.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, A, B.


Output Format

For each test case, print N in base B.
