Description

You are given an array A. One random element is removed from A to form array B and one random element is removed from B to form array C. You have to find the missing element in B and the missing element in C.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 

The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - array A.

The third line of each test case contains (N-1) space-separated integers - array B.

The fourth line of each test case contains (N-2) space-separated integers - array C.


Output Format

For each test case, print the missing element in B and the missing element in C.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 106

2 ≤ N ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all the test cases does not exceed 106.

0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
