Description

You are given an integer N. You have to tell whether the number is prime or not.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N.


Output Format

For each test case, print “YES” if the number is prime and “NO” if the number is not prime.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ N ≤ 107


Sample Input 1

3
5
12
37

Sample Output 1

YES
NO
YES

Note

For the first test case, divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, so it is a prime number.

For the second test case, divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12, so it is not a prime number.

For the third test case, divisors of 37 are 1 and 37, so it is a prime number.
