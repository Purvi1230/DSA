Description

You are given an integer N with no more than 105 digits. You have to find the sum of its digits.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains one integer N.


Output Format

For each test case, print the sum of digits on N on a new line.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 106

1≤ Number of digits in N ≤ 106

It is guaranteed that the sum of the number of digits in N over all the test cases does not exceed 106.
