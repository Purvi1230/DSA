Description

You are given an integer N. You have to tell whether the number is a perfect square/cube according to the given query. Do not use inbuilt sqrt() and cube() function. As sqrt(4) can be equal to 1.9999999 and int(1.999999). = 1. Due to precision issue do not use sqrt() if you are dealing with integers.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers Q, N - Q=1 denotes that you have to check if N is a perfect square and Q=2 denotes that you have to check if N is a perfect cube.


Output Format

For each test case, print “YES” if the number is a perfect square/cube and “NO” if the number is not a perfect square/cube, according to the given query.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ N ≤ 107


Sample Input 1

4
1 64
2 64
2 9
1 5

Sample Output 1

YES
YES
NO
NO

Note

For the first test case, 8*8 = 64, hence it is a perfect square.

For the second test case, 4*4*4 = 64, hence it is a perfect cube.

For the third test case, 9 is not a perfect cube.

For the fourth test case, 5 is not a perfect square.
