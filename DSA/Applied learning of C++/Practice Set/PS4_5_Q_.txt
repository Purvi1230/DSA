Description

You are given matrix A of size N*M and matrix B of size M*P. You have to find the matrix multiplication of A and B.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers, N, M and P.

Each of the next N lines contain M space-separated integers - matrix A.

Each of the next M lines contain P space-separated integers - matrix B.


Output Format

For each test case, print the matrix multiplication of A and B.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10

1 ≤ N, M, P ≤ 100

-103 ≤ Aij, Bij ≤ 103
