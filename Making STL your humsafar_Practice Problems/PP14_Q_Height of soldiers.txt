Description

There are N soldiers standing in a row, numbered 1 through N. The height of i-th soldier is Hi. For each non-empty contiguous segment of the line, strength is defined as the minimum height of the soldier in that segment.
You have to tell the maximum strength for each x size group, for all groups of size x between 1 to N.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers - H1, H2, ... HN, heights of soldiers.


Output Format

For each test case, print N integers in one line. For each x from 1 to N, print the maximum strength among all groups of size x.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Hi ≤ 109
Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 5 x 105

Note

In the first test case of the example, for x=1, possible answers are 1, 5 and 3 (maximum of them is 5).
For x=2, possible answers are 1 and 3 (maximum of them is 3)
For x=3, the only possible answer is 1.

In the second test case of the example, for x=1, possible answers are 1, 6 and 8 (maximum of them is 8).
For x=2, possible answers are 1 and 6 (maximum of them is 6)
For x=3 and x=4, the only possible answer is 1.
