Description

You have to find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of contiguous bars. Assume that all bars have the same width and the width is 1 unit.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer N - the length of the array. 
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers, where Hi denotes the height of the ith bar.


Output Format

For each test case, print the largest area of the rectangle in the histogram.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 100
1≤ N ≤ 105
1≤ Hi ≤ 105

Note

For the first test case, take all the histograms to get area as 3*1 = 3


For the second test case, take the last two histograms to get area as 2*3 = 6


For the third test case, take the first two histograms to get area as 2*4 = 8
