Description

You have given an equation of the form  (a op1 b op2 c) mod p
op1, op2 are operators which can be {+, -, *, /}.
Consider the example: (a * b / c) mod p. Here op1 = * and op2 = /.
It is guaranteed that (a, p) = (b, p) = (c, p) = 1 and p is a prime number.
Compute the value of the equation.

Note: 

(a, b) = 1, means a and b are coprime numbers.
Operators follow the same precedence rules as in mathematics.

Input Format

The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100000), the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains four positive integers a, b, c, and p (1 ≤ a, b, c, p ≤ 109).
It is guaranteed that (a, p) = (b, p) = (c, p) = 1 and p is a prime number.


Output Format

For each test case, print a single number denoting the value of the equation. Since it is mod p, the value must belong to 0 to p - 1.


Sample Input 1

2

(1 + 2 / 1) mod 3

(2 * 3 - 8) mod 5


Sample Output 1

0

3


Note

Explanation 1:
(1 + 2 / 1) mod 3 = 3 mod 3 = 0.

Explanatino 2:
(2 * 3 - 8) mod 5 = -2 mod 5 = 3.
